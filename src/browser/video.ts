/* These functions manage the video element lifecycle for streaming capture. The key challenges we solve:
 *
 * 1. Video context resolution: Video elements may be in the main page or nested inside iframes. Some streaming sites (like those using Brightcove or JW Player
 *    embedded via iframe) require searching through frames to find the video. We detect this based on the site profile's needsIframeHandling flag.
 *
 * 2. Video selection: Pages may have multiple video elements (ads, previews, main content). The selectReadyVideo strategy finds the video with readyState >= 3,
 *    which typically identifies the actively playing main content. The selectFirstVideo strategy simply takes the first video in DOM order.
 *
 * 3. Ready state detection: We wait for readyState >= 3 (HAVE_FUTURE_DATA) rather than readyState === 4 (HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA) because live streams continuously
 *    receive data and may never reach readyState 4. The >= 3 threshold indicates enough data is buffered to begin playback.
 *
 * 4. Fullscreen styling: To maximize capture quality, we apply CSS styles that make the video fill the entire viewport. This CSS-based approach works regardless
 *    of the site's native fullscreen mechanism.
 *
 * 5. Volume enforcement: Some sites aggressively mute videos or lower volume. We enforce volume=1 and muted=false, and for particularly aggressive sites, we use
 *    Object.defineProperty to intercept and ignore attempts to change these values.
 *
 * 6. Recovery escalation: When playback stalls, we use increasingly aggressive recovery techniques:
 *    - Level 1: Basic play/unmute - just call play() and ensure audio is on.
 *    - Level 2: Seek to live edge - jump to the end of the seekable range for live streams.
 *    - Level 3: Reload source - reset video.src and call load() to reinitialize the player.
 *    - Level 4: Full page navigation (handled in monitor.ts, not here).
 *
 * The video selector system uses a string type identifier ("selectReadyVideo" or "selectFirstVideo") that's passed to page.evaluate() and interpreted in the
 * browser context. This avoids using eval() while still allowing dynamic video selection behavior.
 */

/**
 * Builds a selector type identifier for the video element based on the site profile. This returns a string that browser context code interprets to select the
 * appropriate video element. Using a string identifier instead of passing functions avoids serialization issues with page.evaluate() and is more secure than
 * eval()-based approaches.
 * @param profile - The site profile indicating video selection strategy.
 * @returns A selector type identifier: "selectReadyVideo" for sites with multiple videos, "selectFirstVideo" for standard sites.

/* These helper functions encapsulate common video element operations that are used in both initial setup and health monitoring. By centralizing these operations,
 * we ensure consistent behavior and reduce code duplication across the codebase.
 *
 * Many functions below contain identical video selection logic. This duplication is intentional and unavoidable due to Puppeteer's architecture. When we call
 * evaluateWithAbort(), the function body is serialized as a string and executed in Chrome's browser context. We cannot import shared modules (browser context has
 * no access to Node modules), pass function references (only serializable data crosses the boundary), or use closures over Node-side variables (they don't exist
 * in the browser). Each browser-context function must be self-contained. The duplication is the cost of operating across the Node/browser boundary. To maintain
 * consistency, all video selector blocks must use the same pattern, and when modifying the selection logic, update all functions that use this pattern.
 * - The selectorType parameter MUST be passed as the first argument to evaluateWithAbort
 */

// Fullscreen activation queue. Chrome's Fullscreen API requires the target tab to be in the foreground (focused). When multiple streams start concurrently, each
// tab must call page.bringToFront() before requestFullscreen() — but without serialization, tabs steal foreground from each other, causing silent failures. We
// serialize the bringToFront → triggerFullscreen → verify sequence using a promise chain so each tab gets exclusive foreground access during fullscreen activation.

/**
 * Tunes to a channel by navigating to the URL and initializing video playback. This is the single source of truth for channel initialization, used by both initial
 * stream setup and recovery. Having one authoritative function ensures consistent behavior and prevents code divergence between setup and recovery paths.
 *
 * The tuning process:
 * 0. Check cache: If a direct watch URL is cached, navigate to it and skip channel selection. On failure, invalidate and fall through.
 * 1. Navigate: Load the target URL using site-appropriate wait conditions
 * 2. Select channel: For multi-channel players, click the desired channel in the UI
 * 3. Find video: Locate the video element (which may be in an iframe)
 * 4. Click to play: For Brightcove-style players, click the video to start playback
 * 5. Wait for ready: Ensure the video has buffered enough data to play
 * 6. Ensure playback: Start playback, unmute, and apply fullscreen styling
 *
 * Note: Stream context for logging is automatically retrieved from AsyncLocalStorage. Callers should wrap their stream handling code in runWithStreamContext() to
 * ensure log messages include the stream ID prefix.
 *
 * @param page - The Puppeteer page object.
 * @param url - The URL to navigate to.
 * @param profile - The site profile containing all behavior flags.
 * @returns The video context (frame or page) for subsequent monitoring.
