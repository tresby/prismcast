/* The Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) provides low-level access to Chrome's internal state and capabilities. While Puppeteer abstracts most common operations, some
 * features require direct CDP access:
 *
 * - Window management: Setting window size, position, and state (minimized, maximized, fullscreen). Puppeteer's viewport API controls the content area, but we
 *   need CDP to control the entire window including browser chrome.
 *
 * - Browser-level operations: Operations that affect the browser rather than a specific page, like getting the window ID for a page's target.
 *
 * CDP sessions are created per-page and must be managed carefully:
 * - Sessions can fail if the page or target is closed while we're using it
 * - The "No target with given id" error is common and expected when pages close during operations
 * - We wrap CDP operations in try/catch to handle these transient errors gracefully
 *
 * The withCDPSession helper encapsulates the common pattern of creating a session, getting the window ID, performing an operation, and handling errors.

/**
 * Executes a CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) operation with proper session lifecycle management. This helper handles the common pattern of:
 * 1. Creating a CDP session attached to the page's target
 * 2. Getting the browser window ID for the page
 * 3. Calling the provided operation with the session and window ID
 * 4. Gracefully handling errors when the page is closed during the operation
 *
 * The session is created fresh for each call rather than being reused because CDP sessions become invalid when the page navigates or closes. Creating a new
 * session ensures we always have a valid connection.
 * @param page - The Puppeteer page object to create a CDP session for.
 * @param operation - An async function that receives the CDP session and window ID. The operation can use any CDP commands via session.send().
 * @returns The result of the operation, or undefined if the page was closed or an error occurred.

/**
 * Resizes the browser window to match our target viewport dimensions and optionally minimizes it. This function solves the problem of ensuring the video content

 *
 * The complication is that browser windows have "chrome" - the title bar, toolbar, borders, and other UI elements that take up space. If we set the window size
 * to 1280x720, the actual content area will be smaller (perhaps 1280x670 after accounting for the toolbar). To get a 1280x720 content area, we need to add the
 * chrome dimensions to our window size.
 *
 * This function:
 * 1. Measures the current chrome dimensions by comparing window.outerWidth/Height to window.innerWidth/Height
 * 2. Sets the window size to viewport + chrome dimensions, giving us the exact viewport size we want
 * 3. Optionally minimizes the window to reduce GPU usage while still allowing capture
 * @param page - The Puppeteer page object.
 * @param shouldMinimize - Whether to minimize the window after resizing. Set to true for stream pages (to reduce GPU usage) and false for debug pages (where
 *   visibility is desired).
