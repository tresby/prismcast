/* Multi-channel streaming sites (like USA Network) present multiple channels on a single page, with a program guide for each channel. Users must select which
 * channel they want to watch by clicking on a show in the guide. This module coordinates the dispatch to per-provider strategy functions in the tuning/ directory.
 *
 * Each strategy is a self-contained file under tuning/ that exports a single ChannelStrategyEntry object. The coordinator handles pre-dispatch concerns (image
 * polling, no-op checks) and post-dispatch logging. Strategy files may import scrollAndClick() and normalizeChannelName() from this coordinator — the circular
 * import is safe because all cross-module calls happen inside async functions long after module evaluation completes.
 */

/* Adding a new channel selection provider:
 *
 * 1. Create a new file in tuning/ implementing the strategy function with the ChannelStrategyHandler signature.
 * 2. Export a single ChannelStrategyEntry object from the file. Set the hooks your provider needs:
 *    - execute (required): The strategy function that selects the channel in the provider's guide UI.
 *    - clearCache: If your strategy caches state (row positions, URLs), provide a function that clears it.
 *    - resolveDirectUrl / invalidateDirectUrl: If your strategy discovers stable watch URLs that can be reused across tunes, provide cache lookup and invalidation.
 *    - usesImageSlug: Set to true if channelSelector is an image URL slug requiring load polling before dispatch.
 * 3. Import the entry here and add it to the strategies registry with the strategy name as the key.
 * 4. Add the strategy name to the ChannelSelectionStrategy union type in types/index.ts.
 * 5. Add a site profile entry in config/sites.ts that references the new strategy name.
 *
 * The coordinator handles all cross-cutting concerns (dispatch, cache clearing, direct URL resolution, image polling) through the ChannelStrategyEntry interface.
 * Strategy files may import scrollAndClick(), normalizeChannelName(), and logAvailableChannels() from this module for shared utilities.
