/* These functions handle the Chrome browser lifecycle: startup, cleanup, and instance management. The browser is a shared resource used by all streaming sessions,
 * so careful lifecycle management is essential for reliability. Key considerations:
 *
 * - Single browser instance: We use one Chrome process for all streams to minimize resource overhead. Each stream gets its own tab (page) within that browser.
 *
 * - Profile locking: Chrome locks its user data directory while running. If a previous instance crashed without releasing the lock, we must kill it before
 *   launching a new browser.
 *
 * - Crash recovery: The browser can crash or disconnect unexpectedly. When this happens, we clean up all active streams (they cannot continue without a browser)
 *   and reset state so the next stream request will launch a fresh browser.
 *
 * - Extension initialization: The puppeteer-stream extension needs time after browser launch to inject its recording APIs. We wait for this initialization before
 *   attempting to capture streams.

/**
 * Ensures a clean slate for browser launch by terminating any stale Chrome processes and removing orphaned profile lock files. Chrome locks its profile directory
 * while running, and if a previous instance crashed without releasing the lock, we cannot launch a new browser with the same profile. This function uses pkill to
 * find and terminate any Chrome processes whose command line contains our profile directory path, then polls pgrep to verify the processes have actually exited.
 * After process cleanup, it removes stale lock files (SingletonLock, SingletonCookie, SingletonSocket) and DevToolsActivePort from the profile directory.
 *
 * The termination strategy escalates from SIGTERM to SIGKILL. SIGTERM is sent first, giving Chrome up to 5 seconds to flush its profile databases (LevelDB,
 * extension state, session storage) and exit cleanly. If Chrome does not exit, SIGKILL is sent as a fallback. This escalation is critical when called from the
 * process exit handler — Chrome may be running normally (e.g., after a capture probe timeout), and an immediate SIGKILL would corrupt its profile databases,
 * poisoning the Docker volume for subsequent container restarts.
 *
 * The file cleanup is essential for Docker deployments. Container restarts destroy Chrome processes without giving them a chance to release profile locks, but the
 * lock files persist in the mounted volume. Without removing them, Chrome cannot start in the new container, causing a crash loop.
 *
 * This is called at startup before launching the browser and after closeBrowser() during shutdown. It's safe to call even when no stale processes or files exist.

     * --disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows: Prevents Chrome from reducing activity when the window is covered by other windows. Similar to the timer
