     *   pages, which can break video players that load some assets over HTTP.
     *
     * --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required: Allows video and audio to play without requiring a user click first. Essential for automated streaming
     *   since we cannot simulate genuine user interaction for autoplay policy purposes.
     *
     * --disable-background-media-suspend: Prevents Chrome from pausing media when the tab is backgrounded or the window is minimized. Critical since we
     *   minimize the browser to reduce GPU usage but still need media to play.
     *
     * --disable-background-networking: Reduces unnecessary network activity from background Chrome services (Safe Browsing updates, etc). This reduces
     *   resource usage and potential interference with stream capture.
     *
     * --disable-background-timer-throttling: Prevents Chrome from throttling JavaScript timers in background tabs. Video players often use timers for
     *   playback state management, and throttling can cause stuttering or stalls.
     *
     * --disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows: Prevents Chrome from reducing activity when the window is covered by other windows. Similar to the timer
     *   throttling issue, this ensures consistent playback even when the browser isn't visible.
     *
     * --disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled: Hides the navigator.webdriver property that indicates automated control. Some sites detect and block
     *   automated browsers; this flag helps avoid that detection.
     *
     * --disable-notifications: Prevents notification permission prompts and popups that could interfere with video capture or require user interaction.
     *
     * --hide-crash-restore-bubble: Suppresses the "Chrome didn't shut down correctly" dialog that appears after a crash. This prevents the dialog from
     *   blocking the viewport during capture.
     *
     * --hide-scrollbars: Removes scrollbars from the viewport to ensure the video fills the entire capture area without UI chrome.
     *
     * --no-first-run: Skips the first-run experience dialogs and setup wizard that would require user interaction.
     *
     * --window-size: Sets the initial window size to match our configured viewport dimensions. This is later adjusted via CDP to account for browser chrome.
