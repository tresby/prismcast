 * 2. Prefix+digit: cache key starts with the name followed by a space and a digit. Catches local affiliates displayed as "{Network} {Number}" (e.g., "nbc 5",

 * 3. Parenthetical suffix: cache key starts with the name followed by " (". Catches timezone/region variants like "magnolia network (pacific)".
 *
 * When a non-exact match succeeds, the result is also cached under the primary channelSelector key for O(1) lookup on subsequent calls. This function doubles as
 * the resolveDirectUrl hook — after the first tune populates the cache via bulk scrape, every subsequent YTTV tune resolves here without loading the guide page.
