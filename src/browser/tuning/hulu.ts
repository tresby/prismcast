/**
 * Guide grid strategy: finds a channel in a virtualized, alphabetically sorted channel grid by scrolling the page to the target row using binary search, then
 * clicking the on-now program cell to open the playback overlay. This strategy works for sites like Hulu Live TV where the channel guide is rendered as a
 * virtualized list — only ~13 of ~124 rows exist in the DOM at any time, positioned absolutely within a tall spacer div. The virtualizer renders rows based on
 * the page scroll position (`document.documentElement.scrollTop`), so we scroll to bring the target channel into the DOM, then interact with it directly.
 *
 * Three mechanisms handle different channel types:
 * 1. Binary search with passive row number caching — primary mechanism for most channels (~800ms first time, ~200ms on cache hit)
 * 2. Position-based inference — handles local affiliates when searching by network name (e.g., "ABC" finds WLS at the right sort position)
 * 3. Linear scan fallback — safety net for raw call sign searches or any channel the binary search cannot find (~2.4 seconds)
 *
 * The selection process:
 * 1. If listSelector is provided, click the tab/button to reveal the channel list (e.g., a "Channels" tab)
 * 2. Wait for the channel grid rows to render in the DOM
 * 3. Check the row number cache for a direct-scroll shortcut
 * 4. Binary search: scroll to the midpoint row, read rendered channels (caching row numbers), check for exact match or infer local affiliate
 * 5. If binary search fails, linear scan from top to bottom as a universal fallback
 * 6. Click the on-now program cell (`.LiveGuideProgram--first`) in the target channel's row to open the playback overlay
 * 7. If playSelector is provided, wait for and click the play button to start live playback
 * @param page - The Puppeteer page object.
 * @param profile - The resolved site profile with a non-null channelSelector (channel name) and channelSelection config.
 * @returns Result object with success status and optional failure reason.
