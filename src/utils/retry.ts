/* The retry system provides resilient operation execution with exponential backoff and jitter. When operations fail due to transient issues like network hiccups or
 * slow page loads, the system automatically retries with increasing delays. The exponential backoff prevents overwhelming struggling services, while jitter prevents
 * multiple clients from synchronizing their retry attempts.
 */

/**
 * Implements a generic retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter. This function attempts an operation multiple times, waiting progressively longer between
 * attempts to avoid overwhelming failing services. The exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd problems where many clients retry simultaneously.
 * @param operation - An async function to attempt. Should throw on failure.
 * @param maxAttempts - Maximum number of attempts before giving up.
 * @param timeoutMs - Timeout in milliseconds for each individual attempt.
 * @param description - Human-readable description for logging purposes.
 * @param earlySuccessCheck - Optional async function called after timeout errors. If it returns a truthy value, that value is returned as success instead of
 *                            retrying. Useful for cases where the operation succeeded but took too long.
 * @param shouldAbort - Optional function called before each attempt. If it returns true, retries are aborted immediately. Useful for checking if the page was closed
 *                      during the backoff delay.
 * @returns The result of the operation if successful.
 * @throws The last error encountered if all attempts fail.
