 * PLAYLIST GENERATION
 *
 * The playlist endpoint generates an M3U playlist in Channels DVR format. The playlist includes all configured video channels with their stream URLs dynamically
 * constructed from the request host header so the playlist works regardless of how the server is accessed.
 */

/**
 * Resolves the base URL from an incoming request by examining headers in priority order. This ensures that playlist URLs and other generated links use the same
 * host and protocol that the client used to connect, even when behind a reverse proxy. The resolution order is:
 *
 * 1. X-Forwarded-Host header (set by reverse proxies like nginx, Traefik)
 * 2. Host header (standard HTTP/1.1 header)
 * 3. Fallback to configured server host and port
 *
 * For protocol, Express's req.protocol already respects X-Forwarded-Proto when trust proxy is enabled.
 *
 * @param req - The Express request object.
 * @returns The base URL (e.g., "http://localhost:5589" or "https://myserver.example.com").
