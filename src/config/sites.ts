/*
 * Streaming sites implement their video players in wildly different ways. Some use standard HTML5 video with keyboard shortcuts, others embed players in iframes,
 * and many have unique quirks like auto-muting or requiring specific fullscreen methods. Rather than scattering site-specific conditionals throughout the streaming
 * code, we define "site profiles" that describe each site's behavior in a declarative way.
 *
 * The profile system has three components:
 *
 * 1. SITE_PROFILES: Named behavior configurations describing how to handle different player implementations. Profiles can inherit from other profiles using the
 *    "extends" property, allowing us to define base profiles for common patterns (like "keyboardFullscreen" for sites using the f key) and then extend them with
 *    site-specific variations.
 *
 * 2. DOMAIN_CONFIG: A mapping from domain patterns to site profiles and provider display names. When streaming a URL, we check if it matches any known domain and
 *    use the corresponding profile. Provider display names give friendly labels (e.g., "Hulu" instead of "hulu.com") for the UI source column and provider
 *    dropdowns. This is the primary mechanism for automatically selecting the right behavior and generating friendly display names.
 *
 * 3. Channel-level profile hints: Individual channel definitions can specify an explicit profile name, overriding URL-based detection. This is useful when a
 *    channel's URL doesn't match the expected domain pattern, or when the same domain serves multiple channel types that need different handling.
 *
 * Profile resolution happens at stream startup and the resolved profile is passed through the entire streaming pipeline. The profile flags control:
 * - How fullscreen is triggered (keyboard shortcut vs JavaScript API)
 * - Whether to search for video elements in iframes
 * - Which video element to select when multiple exist
 * - Whether to wait for network activity to settle before playback
 * - Whether to lock volume properties to prevent auto-muting
 * - Whether the page is static content (no video element expected)
 *
 * When adding support for a new streaming site, first check if an existing profile matches its behavior. Only create a new profile if the site requires unique
 * handling not covered by existing profiles.
 */

/*
 * Each profile defines a set of behavior flags that control how we interact with the video player. Profiles are organized in an inheritance hierarchy based on
 * behavior patterns rather than site ownership. This makes it easier to identify the right profile when adding new channels.
 *
 * Base profiles (no extends):
 * - keyboardFullscreen: Sites using the f key for fullscreen toggle
 * - fullscreenApi: Sites requiring the JavaScript requestFullscreen() API
 * - staticPage: Non-video pages captured as static visual content
 *
 * Derived profiles (extends a base):
 * - keyboardDynamic: Keyboard fullscreen + network idle wait (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardMultiVideo: Keyboard fullscreen + multi-video selection (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardIframe: Keyboard fullscreen + iframe handling (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardDynamicMultiVideo: Keyboard + network idle + multi-video selection (extends keyboardDynamic)
 * - clickToPlayKeyboard: Click to start playback + keyboard fullscreen (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - brightcove: Brightcove players using API fullscreen + network idle wait (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - clickToPlayApi: Click to start playback + API fullscreen (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - disneyNow: DisneyNOW player with play button overlay + multi-video (extends clickToPlayApi)
 * - embeddedPlayer: Iframe-based players using fullscreen API (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - apiMultiVideo: API fullscreen + multi-video + tile-based channel selection (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - huluLive: Hulu Live TV with guide grid channel selection + fullscreen button (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - embeddedDynamicMultiVideo: Embedded + network idle + multi-video selection (extends embeddedPlayer)
 * - embeddedVolumeLock: Embedded + volume property locking (extends embeddedPlayer)
 * - youtubeTV: YouTube TV with non-virtualized EPG grid channel selection (extends fullscreenApi)
 *
 * Each profile includes a description field documenting its purpose. This is metadata only - it's stripped during profile resolution and exists purely for
 * documentation.
