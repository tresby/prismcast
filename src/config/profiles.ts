/*
 * SITE PROFILES SYSTEM
 *
 * Streaming sites implement their video players in wildly different ways. Some use standard HTML5 video with keyboard shortcuts, others embed players in iframes,
 * and many have unique quirks like auto-muting or requiring specific fullscreen methods. Rather than scattering site-specific conditionals throughout the streaming
 * code, we define "site profiles" that describe each site's behavior in a declarative way.
 *
 * The profile system has three components:
 *
 * 1. SITE_PROFILES: Named behavior configurations describing how to handle different player implementations. Profiles can inherit from other profiles using the
 *    "extends" property, allowing us to define base profiles for common patterns (like "keyboardFullscreen" for sites using the f key) and then extend them with
 *    site-specific variations.
 *
 * 2. DOMAIN_TO_PROFILE: A mapping from domain patterns to profile names. When streaming a URL, we check if it matches any known domain and use the corresponding
 *    profile. This is the primary mechanism for automatically selecting the right behavior.
 *
 * 3. Channel-level profile hints: Individual channel definitions can specify an explicit profile name, overriding URL-based detection. This is useful when a
 *    channel's URL doesn't match the expected domain pattern, or when the same domain serves multiple channel types that need different handling.
 *
 * Profile resolution happens at stream startup and the resolved profile is passed through the entire streaming pipeline. The profile flags control:
 * - How fullscreen is triggered (keyboard shortcut vs JavaScript API)
 * - Whether to search for video elements in iframes
 * - Which video element to select when multiple exist
 * - Whether to wait for network activity to settle before playback
 * - Whether to lock volume properties to prevent auto-muting
 * - Whether the page is static content (no video element expected)
 *
 * When adding support for a new streaming site, first check if an existing profile matches its behavior. Only create a new profile if the site requires unique
 * handling not covered by existing profiles.
 */

/*
 * SITE PROFILES
 *
 * Each profile defines a set of behavior flags that control how we interact with the video player. Profiles are organized in an inheritance hierarchy based on
 * behavior patterns rather than site ownership. This makes it easier to identify the right profile when adding new channels.
 *
 * Base profiles (no extends):
 * - keyboardFullscreen: Sites using the f key for fullscreen toggle
 * - fullscreenApi: Sites requiring the JavaScript requestFullscreen() API
 * - staticPage: Non-video pages captured as static visual content
 *
 * Derived profiles (extends a base):
 * - keyboardDynamic: Keyboard fullscreen + network idle wait (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardMultiVideo: Keyboard fullscreen + multi-video selection (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardIframe: Keyboard fullscreen + iframe handling (extends keyboardFullscreen)
 * - keyboardDynamicMultiVideo: Keyboard + network idle + multi-video selection (extends keyboardDynamic)
 * - brightcove: Brightcove players using API fullscreen + network idle wait (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - embeddedPlayer: Iframe-based players using fullscreen API (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - apiMultiVideo: API fullscreen + multi-video + tile-based channel selection (extends fullscreenApi)
 * - embeddedDynamicMultiVideo: Embedded + network idle + multi-video selection (extends embeddedPlayer)
 * - embeddedVolumeLock: Embedded + volume property locking (extends embeddedPlayer)
 *
 * Each profile includes a description field documenting its purpose. This is metadata only - it's stripped during profile resolution and exists purely for
 * documentation.

/*
 * DOMAIN TO PROFILE MAPPING
 *
 * This mapping associates domain patterns with profile names for automatic profile detection. When resolving a profile for a URL, we check if the URL contains any
 * of these domain strings. Using string containment rather than exact hostname matching allows us to handle:
 *
 * - Subdomains: "www.nbc.com" matches "nbc.com"
 * - Path-based matching: "example.com/live" would match "example.com"
 * - Regional variations: "nbc.com.au" would match "nbc.com"
 *
 * The mapping is checked in Object.keys() order, so more specific domains should be listed if there's potential overlap. For example, if "news.site.com" and
 * "site.com" both existed, the first matching entry would be used.
 *
 * Domains not listed here will use DEFAULT_SITE_PROFILE, which works for most standard video players. Only add entries here when a site requires specific handling.

 * - Use standard HTML5 video without iframe embedding
 * - Have a single video element on the page
 * - Don't require clicking to start playback
 * - Don't auto-mute aggressively
 * - Don't require waiting for network activity
 * - Have video content (not static pages)
 *
 * Neither keyboard fullscreen nor API fullscreen is enabled by default because many sites work fine without explicit fullscreen triggering - the video is already
 * displayed at full size in the viewport. Fullscreen is only needed when the player has visible controls or surrounding content that we want to hide.

/*
 * PROFILE RESOLUTION
 *
 * Profile resolution is the process of determining which behavior flags to use for a given stream. The resolution process handles inheritance, merging parent and
 * child profile properties, and falling back to defaults for unspecified flags.
 *
 * Resolution order (highest to lowest priority):
 * 1. Channel's explicit profile property (if specified)
 * 2. URL-based detection via DOMAIN_TO_PROFILE
 * 3. DEFAULT_SITE_PROFILE
 *
 * Within a profile, inheritance works as follows:
 * 1. Start with DEFAULT_SITE_PROFILE for base values
 * 2. Apply parent profile properties (if extends is set)
 * 3. Apply current profile properties (overriding parent)
 *
 * This allows profiles like "embeddedDynamicMultiVideo" to inherit iframe handling from "embeddedPlayer" which inherits API fullscreen from "fullscreenApi",
 * building up the complete set of behavior flags through the inheritance chain.
