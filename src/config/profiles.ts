/* Profile resolution is the process of determining which behavior flags to use for a given stream. The resolution process handles inheritance, merging parent and
 * child profile properties, and falling back to defaults for unspecified flags.
 *
 * Resolution order (highest to lowest priority):
 *
 * 1. Channel's explicit profile property (if specified)
 * 2. URL-based detection via DOMAIN_CONFIG
 * 3. DEFAULT_SITE_PROFILE
 *
 * Within a profile, inheritance works as follows:
 *
 * 1. Start with DEFAULT_SITE_PROFILE for base values
 * 2. Apply parent profile properties (if extends is set)
 * 3. Apply current profile properties (overriding parent)
 *
 * This allows profiles like "embeddedDynamicMultiVideo" to inherit iframe handling from "embeddedPlayer" which inherits API fullscreen from "fullscreenApi",
 * building up the complete set of behavior flags through the inheritance chain.
