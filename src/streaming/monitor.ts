/* Live video streams can fail in many ways: the network can drop, the player can stall, the site can auto-pause, or ads can break playback. The health monitor
 * watches for these failures and attempts recovery. This is essential for unattended DVR recording where the user cannot manually intervene.
 *
 * The monitor runs on a configurable interval (default: 2 seconds) and performs these checks:
 *
 * 1. Video progression: Compares currentTime to previous check. If currentTime has not advanced by at least STALL_THRESHOLD (0.1 seconds), the video is considered
 *    stalled. However, a single stall is not enough to trigger recovery - we require more than STALL_COUNT_THRESHOLD (default 2, so 3+) consecutive stalls to avoid
 *    reacting to momentary hiccups. Pause detection uses the same threshold — the video.paused property must be true for more than STALL_COUNT_THRESHOLD consecutive
 *    checks before triggering L1 recovery. This filters out transient rebuffer pauses where the player briefly pauses to refill its buffer and resumes on its own.
 *
 * 2. Buffering detection: Checks readyState and networkState to detect active buffering. Live streams occasionally buffer due to network conditions, so we allow a
 *    BUFFERING_GRACE_PERIOD (default 10 seconds) before declaring a stall. This prevents unnecessary recovery during normal buffering.
 *
 * 3. Volume enforcement: Some sites aggressively mute videos (e.g., France24). The monitor checks and restores volume on every interval to ensure audio capture.
 *
 * 4. Issue-aware recovery: When issues are detected, recovery is tailored to the issue type:
 *    - Paused issues: Try Level 1 (play/unmute) first, then escalate to Level 2 if that fails.
 *    - Buffering issues: Skip Level 1 (ineffective for buffering) and go directly to Level 2.
 *    - If Level 2 has already been attempted, skip to Level 3 (second L2 attempts always fail).
 *
 *    Recovery levels:
 *    - Level 1: Basic play/unmute and fullscreen (only for paused issues).
 *    - Level 2: Reload video source (first attempt has ~58% success rate).
 *    - Level 3: Full page navigation (always succeeds).
 *
 * 5. Circuit breaker: If too many failures occur within a time window (default: 10 failures in 5 minutes), the stream is considered fundamentally broken and the
 *    circuit breaker trips, terminating the stream. This prevents endless recovery attempts that consume resources.
 *
 * 6. Escalation reset: After SUSTAINED_PLAYBACK_REQUIRED (60 seconds) of healthy playback, the escalation level resets to 0, the source reload tracking clears,
 *    and the circuit breaker resets. This allows a stream that recovered to start fresh, rather than immediately escalating to aggressive recovery on the next issue.
 *
 * 7. Window re-minimize: Recovery actions (especially fullscreen) can cause the browser window to un-minimize. After the recovery grace period passes and the first
 *    healthy check occurs, the window is re-minimized to reduce GPU usage. This happens sooner than the escalation reset (~5-10 seconds vs 60 seconds) because we
 *    don't need to wait for sustained playback to determine the window can be minimized.
 *
 * The monitor is designed to be resilient to page navigations and context changes. When a page navigation recovery is performed, the monitor updates its context
 * reference to the new video context.
