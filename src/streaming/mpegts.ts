/* This module provides a continuous MPEG-TS byte stream from the same capture pipeline used for HLS. It is designed for HDHomeRun-compatible clients (such as Plex)
 * that expect raw MPEG-TS when tuning a channel. The existing capture → segmenter → HLS segments flow is unchanged. Each MPEG-TS client gets its own FFmpeg remuxer
 * that converts stored fMP4 segments to MPEG-TS with codec copy (no transcoding).
 *
 * Data flow per client:
 * 1. Validate channel and check for existing stream
 * 2. If new stream needed, flush HTTP 200 headers immediately (so the client sees "connection accepted")
 * 3. initializeStream() starts the capture, or awaitStreamReadySilent() waits for an in-progress startup
 * 4. Wait for the init segment (ftyp+moov codec configuration)
 * 5. Spawn FFmpeg: -f mp4 -i pipe:0 -c copy -f mpegts pipe:1
 * 6. Write init segment + existing media segments to FFmpeg stdin
 * 7. Subscribe to segment events for new segments in real time
 * 8. Pipe FFmpeg stdout to the HTTP response as video/mp2t
 * 9. On client disconnect or stream termination, kill FFmpeg and clean up
 *
 * The header flush in step 2 prevents client timeouts. Without it, the client receives zero bytes until the entire stream setup completes (4-10+ seconds), which may
 * exceed the client's connection timeout.

// Public Endpoint Handler.

/**
 * Handles MPEG-TS stream requests. Validates the channel, flushes HTTP headers early for new streams, then ensures a capture is running, waits for the init segment,
 * spawns a per-client FFmpeg remuxer, and streams the output.
 *
 * For new streams, headers are flushed before stream setup begins so the client sees an immediate 200 response. This prevents timeout failures during the 4-10+
 * second startup sequence. The trade-off is that error responses cannot be sent after the flush — failures are logged server-side and the connection is closed.
 *
 * Route: GET /stream/:name
 *
 * @param req - Express request object.
 * @param res - Express response object.
