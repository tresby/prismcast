/* This module handles HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) output using fMP4 (fragmented MP4) segments. HLS mode uses MP4/AAC capture from puppeteer-stream, which is then
 * segmented natively without any external dependencies. The overall flow is:
 *
 * 1. Client requests playlist at /hls/:name/stream.m3u8 (predefined channel) or /play?url=...&profile=... (ad-hoc URL)
 * 2. If no stream exists, we call initializeStream() which runs setupStream() and creates a native fMP4 segmenter
 * 3. The segmenter parses the MP4 stream and produces init.mp4 (codec config) + segment0.m4s, segment1.m4s, ...
 * 4. We store init segment and media segments in memory, return playlist to client
 * 5. Client fetches init.mp4 once, then media segments at /hls/:name/segmentN.m4s
 * 6. Idle timeout terminates streams with no recent segment requests
 *
 * Shared streams: If multiple clients request the same channel (or the same ad-hoc URL with the same profile), they share one segmenter. The first client triggers
 * stream creation, and subsequent clients get the existing playlist and segments. Ad-hoc streams are identified by a synthetic key ("play-<hash>") derived from the
 * URL and profile, allowing them to use the same channelToStreamId deduplication mechanism as predefined channels.
