 * CHANNEL DEFINITIONS
 *
 * The channels object maps short channel names to their streaming URLs and optional profile hints. Users can request streams using simple names like /stream/nbc
 * instead of remembering full URLs. The optional profile property allows channels to explicitly declare which site profile to use, which is useful when the URL
 * domain does not match the expected behavior. Channels without an explicit profile use URL-based profile detection.
