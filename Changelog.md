  * Housekeeping.

## 1.2.0 (2026-02-07)
  * New feature: Homebrew tap for macOS installation (`brew install hjdhjd/prismcast/prismcast`). Upgrade it like any Homebrew package after that.
  * New feature: Automated Docker builds based on the contributions of @bnhf. Latest official release can always be installed from: `docker pull ghcr.io/hjdhjd/prismcast:latest`.
  * New feature: Hulu support.
  * Improvement: DisneyNOW, Hulu, Sling, and additional channels and providers added.
  * Improvement: The channels tab has been rethought to handle multiple provider types. Now you can decide which provider you'd like to use for which channel, or override them all with a user-defined channel if you prefer. **Note: I would strongly encourage users to embrace the defaults and not create user-defined channels unless they are necessary in your environment. The predefined channels represent what is tested and will be maintained. If you've defined channels previously that are now built into PrismCast, I would encourage you to streamline your environment and delete the user-defined channel and use the appropriate builtin version. You don't have to do this...but it will make your quality of life better as PrismCast evolves and your user-defined channels don't keep up with PrismCast's updates.**
  * Improvement: UI refinements.
  * Behavior change: native capture mode is now disabled due to a Chrome bug that produces corrupt output after a few minutes. Hopefully Chrome addresses this in the future and I can make this available again.
  * Housekeeping.
